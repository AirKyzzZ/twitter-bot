You're either building for 5 nines uptime or you're not building at all. I've seen projects fail due to poor architecture. Don't let that be you. | The key to scalable architecture is simplicity. Don't over-engineer your app. Focus on clean code and modular design. You'll thank me later when you're not debugging a mess of spaghetti code. | Now, let's talk about load balancing. You can't just throw more servers at the problem. You need a strategy. I've found that a combination of horizontal and vertical scaling works best. But what does that mean for your app?",
