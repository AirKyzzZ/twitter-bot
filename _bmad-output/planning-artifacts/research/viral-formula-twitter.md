The Smart Marketer’s Guide to Winning Twitter in 2025

Let’s be honest. Twitter (aka X) isn’t just for memes or breaking news anymore — it’s a goldmine for building personal brands, driving website traffic, and proving thought leadership.

But what’s the problem?

👉 Everyone wants to write viral threads, but no one has the time to:

Research
Write clean hooks
Structure a thread
Optimize for engagement

That’s where AI comes in. This week, I’m giving you my full workflow on how I use AI (like ChatGPT + a few tools) to write Twitter threads that:

Get clicks
Drive engagement
And sound like you, not a bot.

If you’re a digital marketing executive, content creator, or agency pro, this is your blueprint to go from “trying Twitter” to owning it.

Let’s dive in. 🧠

🧠 Why Twitter Threads Still Work in 2025

Some people say “Twitter is dead.”

Those people don’t understand distribution.

✅ Twitter is still the BEST platform for:

Sharing frameworks, tips, and processes
Building an expert reputation fast
Getting noticed by VCs, founders, and execs
Going viral without needing a perfect video or design

Threads are still hot 🔥 Because if you nail the hook + value, you can grow in days — not months.

💡 What Makes a Twitter Thread Go Viral?

There’s always luck involved, but high-performers share common traits:

🔥 Relatable hook (either curiosity or bold insight)
🧱 Clear structure (step-by-step, numbered list, or story)
📚 Educational or storytelling value
🪝 Open loop at the end of the first tweet
💬 Ends with engagement CTA (comments, saves, RTs)

Now let’s build that with AI. 👇

⚙️ The AI-Powered Twitter Thread Workflow (What I Actually Use)

Here’s my step-by-step system to generate 3–5 high-quality Twitter threads a week using AI.

✍️ Step 1: Pick Your Thread Angle

Start with the type of thread you want:

💡 Tips or framework thread (e.g., “How I grew my agency to $30K/month with just 3 tools”)
🔥 Bold opinion thread (“Content is dying. Here's what’s next.”)
📖 Personal story thread (“I failed 3 startups. The 4th one changed everything.”)
📊 Case study breakdown (“How this D2C brand made $500K from TikTok in 30 days”)
🛠️ Tools/resources thread (“10 AI tools every content creator should know in 2025”)

Prompt ChatGPT:

“Act like a viral Twitter ghostwriter. Write 3 thread hook ideas on [topic]. Make them scroll-stopping and curiosity-driven.”
💥 BOOM. You’ve got options.

🧵 Step 2: Generate the Full Thread

Use a prompt like:

“Write a viral-style Twitter thread based on this hook: ‘Most marketers post content. Smart ones repurpose it 10x.’
Let AI give you a full draft — but don’t post it as-is.

Now it's time to edit it to sound like you.

🎯 Step 3: Polish with Personality & Voice

You don’t want your thread to sound like ChatGPT. You want it to sound like you at your smartest.

So edit for:

✨ Personality (emoji, slang, rhythm)
✂️ Shorter sentences
🧠 Clear takeaways in each tweet
🔁 Add tweet “loops” like:

You can also use tools like:

Typefully – AI writing with tweet layout
Tweet Hunter – Viral tweet database + AI writer
Taplio – Create from LinkedIn content, repurpose to Twitter

🔄 Step 4: Repurpose from Existing Content

Already wrote a blog post? Newsletter? LinkedIn carousel?

Prompt:

“Turn this blog post into a viral-style Twitter thread. Use the top 5 insights. Add hooks, emoji, numbered tweets, and engagement CTA at the end.”
This is how you get 10x more ROI from your long-form content.

📅 Step 5: Schedule + Optimize

Use Typefully or Hypefury to:

Schedule your threads
Track engagement
A/B test hooks
Auto-retweet top threads for more reach

Time it right (try 9AM–12PM local or post-lunch) and engage in replies early to boost visibility.

✨ Example of a Viral-Style AI Thread (Made in Minutes)

Hook: Most marketers post content. Smart ones repurpose it 10x. Here’s how I turn 1 blog post into 10+ tweets, Reels, and LinkedIn posts — in 15 minutes. 🧵

Body:

Content isn’t about volume. It’s about smart distribution.
I use this workflow to create daily content across 5 platforms from 1 blog.
Step 1: Feed the blog into ChatGPT. Prompt: “Break this down into 10 short-form posts for Twitter, IG, and LinkedIn.”
Step 2: Extract the value. Ask AI: “Summarize key stats, frameworks, and one-liners.”
Step 3: Format like a thread. Hook > Value > CTA. Keep each tweet punchy.

...

Don’t post and ghost. Reply to comments. Bookmark your bangers. Show up daily — even if it’s just 1 idea.
AI can’t replace your voice. But it can speed up your workflow 10x.
Follow for more AI workflows like this 🔥 Or DM me “Content Engine” and I’ll send the full toolkit.

🚀 Final Word: Threads Still Build Influence in 2025

Everyone’s chasing video content. But Twitter/X is still the best place to:

Share frameworks
Build a writing habit
Be discovered by smart people
Drive traffic to your offers, content or brand

🧠 Smart creators aren’t choosing between AI and creativity. They’re using AI to scale creativity faster.

So if you’re a digital marketer or brand builder trying to grow in public — Start writing threads. Use AI to make them consistent. Let your voice + value do the rest.

6 Tips To Write Viral Twitter Threads With Ease

Dickie Bush
In today's Digital Writing Compass, I'm going to share with you 4 lessons from my recent Twitter thread that had over 2,000,000 impressions, 7,500 likes, and 1,500 retweets.

You'll walk away with new frameworks for your writing process, for capturing attention & keeping attention, and for maximizing email conversions / Twitter followers from your threads.

I’m going to break down:

My exact writing process
Construction of the lead-in tweet / thread hook
My “attention-keeping” cadence philosophy in action
The clear CTA I used to lock in 1,000 emails & 5,000 followers from the thread
Alright, let’s dive in.


The writing process

If you want to watch the full video of my 55-minute writing session for this thread, scroll all the way to the bottom.

Everything I write starts with 6 questions:

What problem am I solving?
Whose problem am I solving?
What are the benefits of solving the problem?
What promise am I making to the reader?
What emotion am I trying to generate?
What’s the next action I want my reader to take?
And for this thread, here were my exact answers:

1. What problem am I solving?

This thread helps people figure out what it looks like to effectively use clickbait/etc, but then actually deliver value to that attention
A lot of people actually don’t know who Mr Beast is and how quickly he has grown, so this for some people will be an introduction to him
2. Whose problem am I solving?

People who don’t understand the basic principles of capturing, keeping, and delivering value to that attention
3. What are the benefits of solving the problem?

Grow faster, build an audience, go viral on any platform
4. What promise am I making to the reader?

If you do these things, you will start to get higher returns on your content efforts
If you do these things, you 10x your chances of going viral
If you do these things, you will build inevitably build an audience
5. What emotion am I trying to generate?

“Damn, I really wasn’t sure where this was going but there’s a ton here. I am better understanding the moral parts of using clickbait when I create something high-quality.”
6. What’s the next action I want my reader to take?

Realize that you can apply these principles anywhere, YouTube, articles, landing pages, tweets, that these are the timeless principles for winning attention in the digital age
Writing these out gave me a clear roadmap for where I wanted to take the thread.

I was going to:

Create a curiosity gap for how someone could grow so quickly (what everyone wants to do)
Present the tactics in a “challenge your current way of thinking” format (i.e. that it’s okay to use clickbait, your current belief is wrong, and here’s why)
Give the reader actionable, tactical advice that Mr. Beast implements (which keeps readers moving down the page)
At the end, reveal that the real driving force behind Mr. Beast’s success is his incredible focus and work ethic (and the tactics I laid out in the thread are actually secondary, which is what people need to hear).
And I think it’s worth unpacking this way of thinking a bit.

Readers don't want to hear you have to put in 10 years of work with insane obsession and drive to see the results Mr. Beast has seen. They want to go viral NOW!

So in crafting this thread, I kept this simple idea in mind:

“Sell people what they want, but give them what they need.”

‍With that in mind, I started crafting the lead-in tweet.

The lead-in tweet

Alright so – there’s a few things going on here.

First, recognize exactly what I’m promising here – rapid growth, on any platform. That’s what the people want!

I would never make a lead in tweet that said “here’s his 3-part framework for putting in hundreds of thousands of hours and focusing harder than anyone else.”

Why? Because no one wants to hear that!

So in hooking their attention, I focused on selling them what they want – which is to go viral quickly.

Now, for the tactical parts of the lead-in, here’s the framework I used:

“Big bold claim”
Moment-in-time opener: “Over the last 12 months”
Huge number: over 50,000,000 subscribers
Credibility: I binge watched 100 hours to study him
Reader-focused benefit: Here’s his 3-part framework (that YOU can use on any platform)
Big, scroll-stopping thumbnail image (learned from Mr. Beast himself!)
Casting a wide net: “That you can use on any platform.” – Notice, I wanted this thread to go viral. If I would have said “that you can use on YOUTUBE,” that would have shrunk the total size of the audience (since not everyone on Twitter cares about growing a YouTube channel).
Take a second to look at that construction. I hooked their attention with the word KING, brought them into a moment in time, sprinkled in a dash of credibility, and then told the reader exactly what they were going to get (and cast a wide net to capture as many readers as possible).

That’s the lead-in, but just as important is the second tweet.

The second tweet

The lead-in is super important – it gets them to click and expand.

But your second tweet is JUST as important – because you have to give them a reason to keep reading. And from there, you need to continue to reveal new information and keep the reader engaged.


My second tweet uses some of the same frameworks from the first tweet:

“Only 23 years old” – DAMN! Immediately for anyone unfamiliar, that’s interesting
BIG NUMBERS – (90 MILLION, 15 BILLION, $40,000,000)
Mainstream credibility – Referencing squid games (and connects the thumbnail image to this tweet)
Curiosity gap – I strategically left a cliff hanger with “what can we learn?” I actually think I could improved this with something like “and his success comes in just 3 simple steps” or something like that.
At this point, they've read my lead-in tweet and read my second tweet – they're pretty much hooked.

But now, I need to keep their attention. And how I do this is very intentional (again, using tactics from Mr. Beast himself).

Cadence for keeping the reader’s attention

Copywriter Eugene Schwartz has this great quote:

“Your words should read like a slippery slope, each word leading to the next to keep the reader sliding down the page.”

And with Twitter threads, this is extremely important.

Because all the reader has to do is swipe left and right and boom, they’re gone.

Every tweet needs to keep their attention and give them some kind of reason to keep reading.

Here were the last lines of every tweet in the middle of the thread (where I’m doing everything I can to keep the reader engaged):

“So... what can we learn?”
“Let’s dig in:”
“Here’s what I mean:”
“Here’s where it gets fun:”
“This is 100% wrong – and Mr. Beast knows this...”
“Now here’s where it gets interesting:”
“How he gets you hooked is the second lesson:”
“Here’s the INCREDIBLE intro from this video:”
“Link at the end btw”
“And it all comes from a maniacal obsession on 1 thing.”
“And there’s a hugely important lesson here:”
“And when I say obsession, that’s an understatement.”
This thread was 18 tweets long. If you cut out the TL;DR summary at the end, 14 tweets ended with some kind of “open loop.” The reader couldn’t help but keep going!

And since I knew the reader was “inhaling” the information, I brought it all home at the end with a clean summary to help them recall what they learned.

The TL;DR summary to help the reader remember

Since I optimized this thread for pacing and speed, I knew the reader may get to the end and have forgotten a few things mentioned. So, I wrapped it all together in a “slow down and summarize” 3-tweet cadence.




Now the reader has inhaled the whole thread and is keenly aware of everything they just learned. They’re basically eating out of the palm of my hand! Which is where the CTA comes in – it’s time to turn this reader into a follower and potential customer.

The CTA (Call-to-action)

The goals I had for each reader, the “next action” I would want them to take at the end of the thread were as follows:

Get them to subscribe to my email list
Get them to follow me
Get them to retweet the first tweet
So I presented the CTA in that order. First, I gave them a compelling reason to join the email list, tailoring the description of our Ultimate Guide to match the principles I laid out in the thread (but in written form)


Then, I gave them another 2 things to do, in case they skipped the one above. I said they should follow me @dickiebush – importantly I put my handle right there for them to click because I knew quite a few readers would not know who I was (since I was optimizing for virality).

Then, I made it easy for them to jump back to the top of the thread (which you can do by posting your thread, then replying to the very end of it with a link to the top tweet, which you have to do in 2 steps).


And that's it! Here were the final stats on this thread:

2,400,502 impressions
7,294 likes
171 replies
1,382 retweets
1,000+ new email subscribers
All in all, pretty good! Hope this was helpful to give you some insight into the way I “engineer” my writing for specific outcomes.

Lastly, here's a video of me writing this thread if you're interested (it took me about 2 hours of total time spread across 2 writing sessions). This is the first hour going from blank page to outlined and ready to write.

hello, everyone !!
I’m Kishan, a “not-well-known” writer and content marketer right now.
I trying to get famous by learning and sharing the notes, that I learned from YouTube, Linkedin or Substack.
I want to share my thoughts on emails from very well-known creators and influencers because they want to sell their courses or cohorts to us and in the hope of the purchase, they share basic knowledge with me through their every email touch points.
But, I am smart enough (and you are also) to know that you have to learn basics and convert that knowledge into action.
You don’t need to go for the advanced course without trying the basics, because how would you know whether the knowledge you gained is worth it or not?
so always learn the basics, try it yourself and see the results. if it works, then continue and share results and methods with others
And if it does not, then try different things and make it successful.
So, without wasting your time, here is the TWEETS framework that would be used to create engaging content on X
This is not my framework, I learned this from YouTube.
TWEETS Framework for Engaging Content:
T — Trigger with a “Wow” Statement
Open with something unique or controversial to stop scrolling.
Become a member
W — Write with Strong Conviction
Take a firm stance without nuance.
E — Enhance with Specific Details
Use numbers and vivid descriptions for credibility and humour.
E — Elicit Emotional Responses
Write to resonate strongly, even if it frustrates some.
T — Time Your Follow-ups Strategically
Leverage high-engagement tweets for business content.
S — Spark Critical Thinking
Make smart people think, even if they disagree.
Things to remember:
Don’t try to please everyone
Use ChatGPT/Claude/Perplexity to generate content
Mix personal opinions, entertainment, and thought-provoking content
Aim to build a following of smart, engaged people

How To Go Viral on X (Twitter): Case Study + Step-by-Step Strategy
5 MINUTES READ
Why Going Viral on Twitter (X) Matters Right Now

Twitter—sorry, X—is still one of the most misunderstood platforms for growth. While everyone obsesses over Instagram Reels, TikTok trends, or LinkedIn thought leadership, X is quietly producing outsized results for individuals and brands that know how to play the game.

PostNext is your ultimate AI social media management tool for 2025! Master content creation, automate posting across platforms, and grow your audience with smart scheduling and AI-powered captions. All in one place.

AI-powered content creation
Why? Because it’s real-time. It rewards speed, sharpness, and intent. And unlike algorithm-heavy platforms that demand dancing, filters, or paid promotion, X still runs on words, conversations, and timing.

For business owners, that means lower content production costs with potentially higher ROI. For engineers, product owners, and DevOps professionals, it’s a chance to position yourself as a go-to voice in your niche. And for anyone trying to grow influence? Going viral on X opens doors to partnerships, leads, hires, and opportunities you won’t get from other channels.

The Underused Advantage of Twitter (X)

Here’s the thing: X is underestimated. Many businesses treat it as an afterthought, posting the occasional product update or support link. That’s a missed opportunity.

Unlike platforms optimized for entertainment, X is optimized for signal. Thoughtful threads, useful insights, and sharp commentary travel fast. Even a small account can rack up tens of thousands of impressions if the post hits the right audience at the right moment.

Case in point: I once posted a 7-tweet breakdown of how I automated a deployment pipeline for a SaaS client. My account had maybe 1,200 followers at the time. The thread got 150,000+ impressions, 1,000+ likes, and direct DMs from CTOs and founders asking for consulting. That single post generated more revenue than months of outbound emails.

The Power of Specificity and Intent

Most people fail on X because they try to be everything to everyone. They post generic motivational quotes, vague industry predictions, or plain product plugs. That content sinks.

The content that wins? Specific and intentional.

Instead of “DevOps is important for scaling startups,” post:
“Here’s the exact 4-step CI/CD pipeline we used to cut deploy time from 45 minutes to 8 minutes at a 25-person startup.”
Instead of “Marketing needs clarity,” post:
“We doubled our conversion rate by rewriting the CTA from ‘Start free trial’ to ‘Start testing your first workflow in 60 seconds.’”
People engage when they see themselves in the problem—and when the solution feels practical, not theoretical.

PostNext.io actually leans into this by helping creators and businesses map content clusters (topics, sub-topics, recurring formats). That’s what makes repeatability possible, which is where virality becomes strategy, not luck.

The Competitive Edge Over Traditional Methods

Think about the alternatives:

Email outreach: Slow, high rejection, hard to scale.
Cold calls: Expensive, time-consuming, and ignored.
Ads: Effective but pricey, especially in competitive niches.
Now compare that to a single viral post:

Reach: 50k–500k+ impressions in 24 hours.
Cost: Essentially zero (unless you count coffee).
Conversion: Real leads coming to you, not the other way around.
That’s why mastering X content is a competitive edge. It’s a modern form of leverage—especially if you systematize it.

Practical, Repeatable Workflows

Here’s a framework you can use starting today:

Step 1: Research What Works

Use X search or tools like TweetHunter to study viral posts in your niche.
Look for structure: Are they lists, step-by-step threads, or data-driven insights?
Take notes on format, tone, and engagement style.
Step 2: Build Content Pillars

Pick 3–5 recurring themes. (E.g., “automation tips,” “case studies,” “behind-the-scenes builds”).
Use PostNext.io to plan clusters around those pillars so you’re not guessing what to post.
Step 3: Draft With Hooks First

Spend 70% of your time on the first sentence. That’s the scroll-stopper.
Examples:
“Most startups waste 80% of their deploy time. Here’s how to fix it.”
“The most expensive mistake I made as a founder? $120,000 in 48 hours.”
Step 4: Publish at Smart Times

X is global, but timing matters.
Test posting at 9am EST and 12pm EST—two global sweet spots.
PostNext.io can actually schedule for optimized times based on engagement data.
Step 5: Engage Immediately

Stay online for the first 30–60 minutes. Reply to comments. Add context. Push the conversation further.
This signals to the algorithm that your post deserves wider reach.
Step 6: Repurpose & Extend

Turn a viral tweet into a thread.
Expand a thread into a blog post.
Package insights into LinkedIn carousels or even email newsletters.
This workflow removes the guesswork. Virality becomes a byproduct of consistency and structure.

Examples and Comparisons

Let’s compare:

A generic “Happy Monday” tweet: maybe 100 impressions, 1–2 likes.
A specific breakdown: “Here’s how we cut AWS costs by 32% without touching reserved instances.” That could easily hit 50k impressions if it resonates with the right engineers and founders.
The difference? Specificity + context + actionability.

It’s also worth noting: niche > broad. A highly targeted thread that hits 10,000 engineers is more valuable than a broad one that hits 100,000 random users.

Free vs. Paid Tools

You don’t need a fancy stack to win on X—but the right tools help.

Free options

Native X Analytics (basic but helpful).
Google Sheets for content tracking.
Manual scheduling with reminders.
Paid options

TweetHunter or Typefully for advanced drafting and analytics.
PostNext.io for campaign-level planning, cluster mapping, and cross-platform integration. (If you want your X strategy to tie directly into your blog, LinkedIn, or email, this is where it shines.)
Think of PostNext.io as the content brain that keeps you consistent while you focus on writing sharp, viral-ready posts.

The Data Behind Virality

Some quick stats:

Tweets with numbers in the headline get 20–40% more engagement.
Threads (7–12 tweets) outperform single tweets by 2x in impressions on average.
Tweets that include a visual (screenshot, chart, meme) can boost engagement by up to 150%.
These aren’t random hacks—they’re repeatable levers.

Evaluating Results

Don’t just measure likes. Here’s the framework:

Reach – impressions (how far did it spread?).
Engagement – likes, replies, retweets.
Conversion – profile visits, link clicks, DMs.
Pipeline – did it generate leads, hires, or signups?
Pro tip: Use UTM links to track X-driven traffic to your site. With PostNext.io, you can centralize these analytics across all platforms for cleaner reporting.

Building a Long-Term Strategy

Virality is great, but long-term impact comes from compounding.

Think in terms of:

Series: Weekly breakdowns, e.g., “DevOps Friday Tips.”
Clusters: Multiple threads/posts around the same problem set.
Campaigns: Coordinated pushes (e.g., product launch with 3–4 supporting threads).
This makes your account a destination, not just a random poster.

Optimizing for Maximum Impact

Some underused tactics:

Add a call-to-action tweet at the end of a thread (“Follow for more SaaS case studies”).
Use visuals sparingly but intentionally—screenshots of dashboards work wonders.
Pin your highest-performing thread so it keeps compounding impressions.
Retweet your own post 24–48 hours later to catch new eyeballs.
Why Small Audiences Often Win

Here’s the twist: you don’t need a million followers to go viral.

An engineer with 3,000 followers can reach 200k impressions with one sharp thread.
A founder with 5,000 followers can land podcast invites and partnerships after one viral case study.
Small audiences actually have an advantage: their engagement rates are higher, which boosts algorithmic reach.

How to Write Viral Tweets: A No-BS Checklist That Actually Works
How to Write Viral Tweets
Let’s be real: Everyone wants to go viral on 𝕏 (formerly Twitter. But very few know how. Most are just throwing words on the timeline and praying it picks up.

If you’ve ever hit “post” and wondered why your banger got 2 likes and a spam reply from a bot — continue reading.

This is not another fluff piece. This is the game plan, based on real viral tweets stripped down to clarity, emotion, and momentum.

And yes, we’re giving you a repeatable tweet writing checklist you can run every single time.

Let’s dive into it.

Why Most Tweets Don’t Go Viral

They’re trying too hard to sound smart.
They’re too long, too slow, or too abstract.
They don’t make you feel anything.
Or worse — they don’t make you *think* anything new.
Virality isn’t luck. It’s architecture. There’s a reason some tweets hit like cold truth and others just sit there.

Why most tweets don't go viral


What Makes a Tweet Go Viral?

Here’s what you’ll find in almost every high-performing tweet — from health creators to stoic brand builders:

1. Clarity > Cleverness

Your job isn’t to impress. It’s to be understood.

Bad: “Chronobiological inconsistencies will deteriorate metabolic function over decades.”

Good: “Your metabolism didn’t slow because of age. It died with your lifestyle.”

2. Emotion Sells

You don’t need to be a motivational speaker. But you do need to make people feel something.

Anger. Awe. Truth chills. Guilt. Relief. Tap into identity.

Make people say: “Damn! That’s me.”

Example: “All miserable men have the same pattern. They traded responsibility and adventure for comfort and convenience.”

Emotional Tweet

3. Binary = Virality

Viral tweets force a choice. They create tension.

Most people live in the grey. You go black or white.

Example: “You can either become disciplined or stay average. There is no third option.”

binary tweet

4. Pacing Like a Movie Script

Use line breaks. Use rhythm. Use silence.

Bad: “Your metabolism didn’t slow down because you got older…”

Good: “Your metabolism didn’t slow down because of age.

It slowed because of how you lived.

Let me explain.”

Tweet with line break

5. Position Yourself: Guide or Challenger

Are you exposing a lie? Or offering a fix?

If you’re a Challenger, attack BS ideas: “Stop romanticizing 75-hour work weeks. That’s just poor planning in disguise.”

Challenge tweet

If you’re a Guide, offer a lens: “Here’s my 3-part tweet writing checklist. Steal it.”

Guide tweet

6. Visuals That Stop the Scroll

This is optional — but when done right, images can double your engagement.

Use: Action shots, Emotional imagery, Memes

visual tweet

7. Built for Shares, Not Just Scrolls

Ask yourself: Would someone screenshot this? Would they send it to a friend? Would they quote it with “THIS”?

If not, it’s not built to spread.

The Viral Tweet Writing Checklist

🧠 Clarity

Simple, direct language?
Can a 15-year-old get it in one read?
💥 Emotion

Does it provoke: truth chills, motivation, outrage, identity hit?
Would someone say: “Damn! That’s me”?
⚖️ Contrast

Are you using black vs. white framing?
Is there a clear good vs. bad, old vs. new, strong vs. weak?
🔁 Pacing

Line breaks for rhythm?

How to Write Viral Tweets: Complete Guide for 2026
Introduction

How to write viral tweets isn't just about luck—it's a learnable skill backed by data, psychology, and strategic execution. In 2026, Twitter (now X) remains one of the most powerful platforms for building influence, driving traffic, and creating viral moments that reach millions of people. Whether you're a business owner, content creator, or personal brand, understanding the viral tweet formula can transform your social media platform presence overnight.

Every day, billions of tweets compete for attention, but only a tiny fraction achieve viral status. What separates a tweet with 10 likes from one with 10,000 retweets? The answer lies in understanding Twitter's algorithm, human psychology, and proven content frameworks that consistently drive engagement.

In this comprehensive guide, you'll discover the exact strategies, formulas, and frameworks that top creators use to write viral tweets consistently. From understanding the 2026 Twitter algorithm to crafting compelling hooks and optimizing your posting strategy, this guide covers everything you need to master viral tweet writing.

Understanding Twitter's Algorithm in 2026

Before diving into how to write viral tweets, you need to understand how Twitter's algorithm decides which content to amplify. The algorithm has evolved significantly, and in 2026, it prioritizes specific engagement signals that determine whether your tweet reaches 100 people or 100,000 people.

How the Algorithm Scores Your Tweets

Twitter's algorithm picks approximately 1,500 potential tweets for each user's feed, with roughly half from accounts they follow and half from accounts they don't. Each tweet receives a "score" based on predicted engagement potential, which includes:

Early engagement velocity: The first hour after posting is critical. Tweets that generate immediate likes, retweets, and replies signal quality to the algorithm.
Time-on-post metrics: How long users spend viewing your content matters. Threads naturally perform better because they increase time-on-post.
Engagement rate: Your ratio of engagements to impressions demonstrates content quality and relevance.
Profile authority: Accounts with higher follower counts and engagement history receive initial visibility boosts.
Understanding these factors is essential because the algorithm decay is exponential—a tweet loses approximately half its remaining algorithmic boost every six hours. This is why the first few hours after posting are make-or-break for viral potential.

The Three-Hour Window

Research shows that most viral tweets achieve 80% of their total engagement within the first three hours. If your tweet doesn't gain traction quickly, it's unlikely to go viral. This creates a critical window where your content must perform, making your posting time, initial audience response, and content quality paramount to success.

The Core Viral Tweet Formula

After analyzing thousands of viral tweets, a consistent pattern emerges. While execution varies, the underlying viral tweet formula remains remarkably similar across different niches and content types.

The E.H.A. Framework

The most effective viral tweets follow the E.H.A. Framework: Emotional trigger + Hook + Action.

Emotional Trigger: High-arousal emotions spread faster than low-arousal ones. Tweets that evoke awe, excitement, anger, humor, or surprise significantly outperform content that makes people feel sad, content, or neutral. This is why controversial takes and humorous observations dominate viral content—they activate emotional responses that drive sharing behavior.

Hook: The first 5-7 words determine whether someone keeps reading or scrolls past. Effective hooks include bold statements ("This will change everything"), questions ("Why does everyone ignore this?"), numbers ("7 things nobody tells you about..."), or pattern interrupts ("Stop doing X. Start doing Y instead.").

Action: Viral tweets make the next step obvious. Whether it's a clear call-to-action ("Retweet if you agree"), a compelling reason to share ("Your followers need to see this"), or content so valuable that sharing becomes automatic, successful tweets guide readers toward engagement.

The Value-First Principle

The most consistently viral accounts follow a simple rule: provide 10x more value than you ask for in attention. This means every tweet should either teach something valuable, entertain genuinely, or inspire meaningfully. When you consistently deliver value, your audience becomes your distribution network, sharing your content organically because it makes them look good to their followers.

12 Proven Strategies for Writing Viral Tweets

Now that you understand the algorithm and core formula, let's explore specific, actionable strategies for writing viral tweets in 2026.

1. Optimize Your Tweet Length

Data consistently shows that tweets between 71-100 characters have 17% higher engagement rates than longer tweets. However, the sweet spot has evolved—in 2026, tweets under 110 characters perform best because they're easy to scan, leave room for comments when retweeted, and don't overwhelm mobile readers.

The key is saying something meaningful concisely. Trim unnecessary words, use active voice, and make every character count. Think of tweet length like a punch—short, powerful tweets land harder than rambling ones.

2. Master the Hook

Your first line determines everything. Top creators use proven hook formulas:

The Bold Statement: "Nobody talks about this, but..." or "Unpopular opinion:"
The Question Hook: "Want to know the real secret to...?"
The Number Hook: "7 things I wish I knew..."
The Story Hook: "3 years ago I was broke. Today..."
The Pattern Interrupt: "Everyone says X. They're wrong."
Test different hooks on similar content and track your engagement metrics with Twitter analytics tools to identify which formulas resonate with your specific audience.

3. Leverage Emotional Triggers

Psychology research confirms that high-arousal emotions drive sharing behavior. Tweets that make people feel awe, excitement, anger, or amusement get shared exponentially more than content that evokes low-arousal emotions like sadness or contentment.

This doesn't mean being manipulative—it means understanding that people share content that makes them feel something powerful. Educational content that creates "aha moments," humorous observations that make people laugh, or contrarian takes that spark healthy debate all leverage emotional triggers ethically.

4. Ask for Engagement Directly

It sounds simple, but explicitly asking for engagement works. Tweets with phrases like "Retweet if you agree," "Tag someone who needs this," or "Reply with your experience" significantly outperform identical content without calls-to-action.

The key is making the ask feel natural and valuable to your audience. Don't beg for retweets—give people a reason to share that benefits them or their followers.

5. Use Strategic Repetition and Patterns

The human brain loves patterns. Tweets that use parallel structure, rhythmic repetition, or format consistency perform exceptionally well. Examples include:

"Good X does Y. Great X does Z."
"Stop [bad thing]. Start [good thing] instead."
"You don't need [common belief]. You need [contrarian take]."
These patterns make your tweets memorable and quotable, increasing the likelihood that people will share them or remember your account for future engagement.

6. Provide Uncommon Value

In a sea of generic advice, uncommon value stands out. Instead of tweeting "Be consistent," share "I posted at 9am every day for 90 days. Here's what happened to my engagement." Specific insights, personal data, and counterintuitive findings all qualify as uncommon value that drives viral potential.

7. Master the Quote Tweet

Quote tweeting trending topics or popular tweets in your niche can dramatically increase your visibility. The strategy is adding unique perspective or insight to existing viral conversations, riding the engagement wave while showcasing your expertise.

The key is adding genuine value, not just piggybacking. Your quote tweet should provide additional insight, a different angle, or actionable takeaways that enhance the original content.

8. Use Numbers and Data

Tweets with specific numbers and data points outperform vague statements by significant margins. "This increased my engagement" gets ignored. "This increased my engagement by 347% in 30 days" gets attention and shares.

Numbers create credibility, specificity, and curiosity—three essential ingredients for viral content. Track your results and share specific, verifiable data whenever possible.

9. Tell Micro-Stories

Story-based tweets consistently achieve higher engagement because humans are wired for narrative. Even in 280 characters, you can tell compelling micro-stories using the before-after-lesson framework: "I was [problem]. I tried [solution]. Now I'm [result]. Here's what I learned."

These transformation narratives work across every niche because they demonstrate possibility and provide a clear roadmap that readers can follow.

10. Create "Controversy" Through Contrarian Takes

Challenging conventional wisdom—respectfully—drives massive engagement. Tweets that start with "Unpopular opinion" or "Nobody talks about this, but..." signal contrarian content that makes people stop scrolling.

The key is being genuinely contrarian based on experience or data, not being controversial for attention. Authentic contrarian takes backed by reasoning create healthy debate and sharing; hollow hot takes damage credibility.

11. Use the Power of "You"

Second-person language ("you," "your") dramatically increases engagement because it makes content feel personal and directly applicable. Compare "People should focus on X" with "You should focus on X"—the second version creates immediate personal connection and relevance.

12. Optimize Hashtag Usage

Twitter's data confirms that tweets with 1-2 hashtags have 21% higher engagement than those with three or more. In 2026, the strategy is using hashtags strategically rather than stuffing tweets with them.

Focus on one highly relevant hashtag that connects you to your target conversation, or skip hashtags entirely if your content and network are strong enough to drive engagement organically. Quality targeting beats quantity every time.

Content Types That Go Viral

Understanding which content types consistently achieve viral status helps you focus your efforts on formats with proven success rates.

Educational Thread Content

Twitter threads remain one of the most reliable formats for viral content in 2026. They allow extended storytelling, multiple engagement opportunities, and increased time-on-post—all factors the algorithm rewards.

Successful threads follow a specific structure: compelling hook tweet, 5-10 supporting tweets with one key point each, visual breaks every 3-4 tweets, strategic cliffhangers to maintain momentum, and a strong closing tweet with clear call-to-action.

Relatable Observations

Tweets that capture universal experiences ("When you finally understand X" or "Why does nobody talk about Y?") spread rapidly because they make readers feel seen and understood. The shareability comes from "I relate to this and my followers will too" psychology.

Practical How-To Content

Actionable advice with specific steps consistently outperforms theoretical discussion. "How I grew to 10K followers" beats "Thoughts on growth" every time. People share practical content because it provides concrete value to their networks.

Data-Driven Insights

Original research, personal experiments, and data analysis all qualify as high-value content that drives engagement. Sharing "I analyzed 1,000 viral tweets and found..." positions you as an authority while providing actionable insights readers can apply.

Behind-the-Scenes Content

Transparency and vulnerability create powerful connections. Tweets sharing your failures, lessons, revenue numbers, or honest struggles humanize your brand and generate engagement through authenticity and relatability.

Visual Content Strategy

The data is clear: tweets with visual elements receive 150% more retweets than text-only tweets. In 2026's increasingly visual social media landscape, mastering visual content is non-negotiable for consistent viral success.

Images and Graphics

High-quality images, custom graphics, and branded visuals dramatically increase engagement. The key is ensuring visuals add value rather than just filling space. Infographics that visualize data, screenshots that demonstrate points, and eye-catching designs that stop scrolls all serve strategic purposes beyond decoration.

Video Content

Short-form video continues dominating engagement metrics. Tweets with videos generate 10x more engagement than those without. The optimal video length for Twitter is 30-45 seconds—long enough to deliver value but short enough to maintain attention.

Focus on strong opening frames (people decide within 2 seconds whether to watch), adding captions (most viewers watch without sound), and clear payoffs that reward viewers for their time.

GIFs and Memes

Humorous, relatable GIFs and memes spread rapidly because they're easily shareable and emotionally resonant. The key is understanding your audience's humor and cultural references well enough to deploy memes authentically rather than appearing out-of-touch.

Thread Writing Mastery

Twitter threads deserve special attention because they consistently outperform single tweets for viral potential and audience building. Here's how to master thread writing in 2026.

The Perfect Thread Structure

Viral threads follow a proven architecture. The hook tweet (Tweet 1) must be so compelling that it stops scrolls and demands reading the thread. Use the bold statement, credibility marker, or curiosity gap formula: "I spent $50K learning X. Here's everything I learned (so you don't have to)."

The body tweets (Tweets 2-9) each deliver one key insight, example, or step. Keep individual tweets under 250 characters—preferably under 200—for maximum readability. Use line breaks strategically and add visual elements every 3-4 tweets to maintain engagement.

The closing tweet ties everything together, reinforces key points, and includes a clear call-to-action: follow for more content, check out a resource, or engage with a question.

The 3-Bucket Strategy

Consistently viral thread creators follow the 3-Bucket Strategy: Authority content (expert insights and valuable information), Personality content (relatable, human experiences), and Shareable content (highly quotable, broadly applicable insights).

Balance these three buckets across your threads—pure authority without personality feels robotic, pure personality without value feels shallow, and pure shareability without depth feels superficial.

Hook Formulas for Threads

The 4-part thread hook formula maximizes engagement: Bold Statement (surprise or shock factor), Tension (highlight a problem or struggle), Twist (unexpected insight or approach), and Credibility (optional proof of results or expertise).

Example: "Everyone says consistency is key. [BOLD] I posted daily for 6 months and my engagement dropped 60%. [TENSION] Then I discovered the counter-intuitive strategy that actually works. [TWIST] Here's the data from 10,000 tweets: [CREDIBILITY]"

Cliffhanger Technique

Use strategic cliffhangers every 1-2 tweets to maintain momentum and encourage thread completion. Phrases like "But here's where it gets interesting," "The next part is crucial," or "This is where most people mess up" create anticipation that keeps readers engaged through longer content.

Timing and Posting Frequency

When you post matters almost as much as what you post. Strategic timing can mean the difference between a tweet reaching hundreds versus thousands of people.

Optimal Posting Times

Global engagement data reveals three peak windows: 9:00 AM, 12:00 PM (noon), and 1:00 PM in your target audience's timezone. For B2B content, 11 AM-1 PM EST performs best. For B2C content, 12-1 PM Monday-Wednesday shows highest engagement.

However, the best posting time for your specific audience requires testing and measurement. Use Tweet Archivist's analytics features to identify when your audience is most active and responsive, then optimize your posting schedule accordingly.

Posting Frequency Strategy

Quality trumps quantity, but consistency matters. The data suggests 3-5 tweets per day yields optimal results—enough to maintain visibility without overwhelming followers or diluting content quality.

For threads, 2-3 high-quality threads per week outperform daily mediocre threads. Remember that each tweet doesn't need to go viral; your overall consistency and quality build the authority that makes viral moments possible.

The Repost Strategy

Don't assume everyone saw your best content the first time. Strategic reposting—sharing your top-performing tweets 4-6 weeks after the original—can expose great content to new followers and drive additional engagement from your existing audience.

The key is reposting intentionally based on performance data, not mindlessly resharing everything. Focus on content that performed well the first time and remains relevant to your current audience.

Common Mistakes to Avoid

Understanding what not to do is as important as knowing effective strategies. These common mistakes sabotage viral potential and damage long-term growth.

Hashtag Overuse

While hashtags have value, using three or more per tweet reduces engagement by 17% according to Twitter's data. Hashtag stuffing makes tweets look spammy and desperate rather than authoritative and valuable.

Inconsistent Voice and Positioning

Jumping between topics, tones, and perspectives confuses your audience and prevents the focused authority building necessary for viral success. Pick your lane, establish your perspective, and build consistent value in that niche.

Focusing Only on Broadcasting

Twitter is a social platform, not a broadcast channel. Accounts that only post without engaging—responding to comments, participating in conversations, supporting other creators—struggle to build the community necessary for viral amplification.

The 70/30 rule applies here: spend 70% of your Twitter time engaging authentically and 30% creating new content. Your engagement activity builds relationships that amplify your content when you do post.

Chasing Trends Blindly

Jumping on every trending topic without authentic connection to your brand or expertise appears opportunistic and damages credibility. Strategic trend participation works when you have genuine value to add; forced trend-jacking typically backfires.

Ignoring Analytics

Flying blind without tracking what works wastes time and opportunity. Successful creators obsessively track metrics: what content types perform best, which posting times drive engagement, what topics resonate most strongly, and how their growth metrics trend over time.

Set up comprehensive Twitter analytics tracking from day one to inform strategy with data rather than guesswork.

Tools and Analytics for Success

The right tools transform viral tweet writing from luck-based to systematic. Here's how to build your viral content toolkit.

Analytics and Tracking

Professional Twitter analytics go beyond platform-native metrics to provide deeper insights into content performance, audience behavior, and growth opportunities. Tools like Tweet Archivist enable comprehensive historical analysis, hashtag performance tracking, sentiment analysis, and competitive benchmarking that inform strategic decisions.

Track these key metrics consistently: engagement rate (total engagements divided by impressions), best-performing content types, optimal posting times for your audience, follower growth rate, click-through rates on links, and thread completion rates.

Content Planning and Scheduling

While spontaneity has value, strategic content planning ensures consistency—one of the most critical factors for long-term growth. Plan content themes weekly, batch-create tweets during peak creative energy, and schedule strategically to maintain consistent presence without being chained to your phone.

Growth and Engagement Services

For creators serious about accelerating their Twitter growth, services like Bulkoid.com provide targeted follower growth, engagement boosting, and visibility enhancement. These tools work best when combined with strong content strategy—they amplify quality content rather than compensating for poor content.

The key is using growth services ethically and strategically, focusing on attracting genuine followers interested in your niche rather than empty vanity metrics.

Writing and Ideation Tools

Maintain a swipe file of high-performing tweets in your niche, noting what made them successful. Use this research to inspire original content (never copy directly) and identify patterns in viral content within your specific area.

Thread writing benefits from offline drafting in tools that let you see the full structure, edit freely, and refine before posting. Many creators draft threads in Google Docs or Notion before transferring to Twitter, ensuring every tweet in the sequence serves the overall narrative.

Conclusion

Learning how to write viral tweets transforms from mysterious art to systematic skill when you understand the underlying principles: the Twitter algorithm rewards early engagement and time-on-post, emotional triggers drive sharing behavior, concise value delivery beats verbose explanation, and consistent quality builds the authority that makes viral moments possible.

The viral tweet formula—Emotional trigger + Hook + Action—provides a framework for consistent success. Combined with strategic timing, optimized length, visual content, and thread mastery, you have everything needed to dramatically increase your Twitter engagement and reach.

Remember that viral success is ultimately about providing exceptional value to your audience. Focus on teaching something valuable, entertaining genuinely, or inspiring meaningfully with every tweet. When you consistently deliver value, your audience becomes your distribution network, sharing your content because it makes them look good to their followers.

Start implementing these strategies today. Test different hooks, track your analytics, optimize based on data, and refine your approach continuously. Viral tweets aren't accidents—they're the result of understanding your audience, mastering the platform, and executing proven strategies consistently.

Nick the man who needs no introduction but I'm going to give you an introduction anyways you have probably more businesses than you have fingers at this point you are running somewhere. comom which is just taking over as a recruiting agency right now you've got probably 100 million bucks in in self storage facilities you got time to be a good father you got time to troll the internet when hundreds of millions of people see it of course you're of course you're coming here and you're sharing some ideas let's do it [Music] man and I wanted to do something a bit different I want to get inside your brain around how you actually craft content that gets people ticking and I don't know if you can just like open up a Google doc and just start like typing out stuff and we can jam on it how ever it works I want to I want to I want people to listen to this and at the end of it understand how you do it how you're able to be in Athens Georgia and get the entire planet uh to jump up with happiness or or pain or or do something you think that works let's do it man I think we can cover A Lot quickly because my strategy is pretty simple I mean the we all know the framework of great Twitter copy but the mindset is a little bit different and the mindset is that if you try to make every single person like you on the internet if you are worried about what people think if you have thin skin it's it's impossible to do well it really is because if you try to make everybody love you nobody will actually have an opinion on you at all is is the truth so if you're not a little bit different if you're not afraid to put yourself out there and if you're afraid to look silly then it's not for you right so I make myself look stupid sometimes is the bottom line I'm going to I'm going to share my screen and I want to go through tweets and I want to just we've never done this together like we we've never you talking some of the real bangers the viral ones yeah why not and and and and also other people's tweets too and just like what makes them great let's just go through it um I'm G to share my screen can you see my screen I can let's go to you for a second which which tweet well let's I'm going to go through maybe a few tweets and you tell me which one you want me to stop at I mean this one has you know 720,000 Impressions like what were you thinking when you tweeted this so the structure you can see it here I make a statement that people say oh wow that sounds unique I'm not sure if I agree with it or not but that's not like what I mostly hear that first line okay then I spend the rest of the Tweet taking a hard line on one side so there's no Nuance there's no teasing out both sides my structure is hey I'm GNA say something boom whe you know obviously there's Nuance obviously there's two sides of it obviously it doesn't apply to everybody but I'm G to act like it does and I'm going to take a very strong side towards one of them that's the structure of a great tweet so something that not everybody agrees with said as fact with conviction and then a bunch of really strongly written copy to back it up that's how almost all of my viral tweets are structured and how were you thinking about this this reply second tweet it's a little small for me let's see here don't don't buy into here I'll I'll actually make it bigger don't buy into this actually can you see better now yeah so I feel like I just feels super passionate about this in general maybe it's cuz I live in the south maybe it's cuz I see a lot of people making the mistake of waiting too long to have children and I'll read the tweet my advice to 25y olds get married young and have more kids than you can afford that's the wow part of the Tweet right everybody reads that and they're like whoa that's the opposite of what I hear I hear marrying your picking your spouse's like you know the most important decision you'll ever make be very careful about it be very deliberate in it be you know super thoughtful on it and kids are super expensive and I need to be financially secure before I have kids like so Boom the thing that Nick said at the very top is different than what a lot of people say then I go on to take a very hard side towards having more kids younger I've never met anyone who wishes they'd had fewer kids that's a super strong unnuanced take supporting my first line but I've met a lot of people who regret waiting so long or having so few every 60 plus year old that I know cares about one thing Above All Else their kids and their grandkids that is just a super powerful convincing thing that's also super triggering to people who disagree with it and what percentage like what percentage true is this tweet I pretty strongly believe so look it's it's it's geared towards my target person obviously not everybody is in the situation where this applies to them right they're people with mental issues they're struggling with alcohol they're literally do not have their own life together and they have no business getting married and trying to support a child but I'm talking to to the people who are like me because that's the majority of people who follow me on the internet are competent people 30 to 40 to 50 years old who are kicking ass at their career they're making money they're into entrepreneurship they're into business and maybe they've just kind of forgot that holy cow kids are super important to live a rewarding life then I make the second tweet don't buy into the illusion of choice because you hear the excuse all the time of guys and girls alike being like I just want to travel I want to get out of my system I want to go live my life and you know do all these things before I have kids and I personally pretty strongly believe that that's and it actually creates a bunch of bad habits that are really hard to break when you actually do want to settle down so my second tweet I just lean in don't buy into the illusion of choice you know don't buy into the lie that is getting out of your system if you travel and sleep around and do whatever you want for 20 years it'll be even harder for you bad habits die hard and that just it just lights people up right I think the the strategy by the way of like double Downing on your second line always hits hard yep yeah catchy catchy little intro my advice to every 25y old okay I'm going to read this because I want to know what Nick advises 25 year olds and then boom a super strong controversial Viewpoint and then me taking one side even though if I were in a conversation with somebody you discuss the Nuance like right we can we can discuss the Nuance of this right now that having kids is not right for everybody but I do think a lot of people make this mistake so my goal with this was to make people think twice about it totally and by the way for for for this pod like it's okay what we're talking about right now is how to create content that goes viral so we're not talking about nuances and stuff like that it's really just about how you're structuring it and what the insights are right yeah Nuance um the lesson here is that Nuance does not go viral yeah Nuance does not go viral all right I'm to continue scrolling and then let me know uh when I should stop yeah I'll scroll too shh don't tell anyone but I've got 30 plus startup ideas that could make you millions and I'm giving them away for free these aren't just random guesses they're validated Concepts from entrepreneurs who built hundred million plus businesses I compiled them into one simple database compiled from hundreds of conversations I've had on my podcast but the main thing is most of these ideas don't need a single investor some cost nothing to start I'm pretty much handing you a cheat sheet the idea bank is your startup shortcut just click below to get access your next cash flowing business is waiting for you oh this is a good one dude okay could you do this one yeah all you have to do is refuse video games until about the age of 16 then your kids will be so far behind their friends it won't be fun for them they'll give up and focus on real life virtually no chance they'll grow old to spend 20 hours a week on a computer casting spells it's a say uh it triggers all the people who sit around and play video games as a hobby because it's true that video games while they do add a lot of critical thinking skills and maybe people argue hand eye coordination I disagree with that but um they argue the benefits of it I don't think they're very beneficial so I took that hard line and it it frustrated and made Angry a lot of uh Gamers yeah and the reality is you actually believe this you know and so it's like you're twe things that you believe which I think is whether I agree with you or not like I actually disagree with you but I know that you believe this because I remember texting some you know you I was like I played video games today and you're like basically why um but it's cool that we can still be friends and just have differing opinions you know um I get a lot of messages I get a lot of messages from people who support me and follow me and want to and want to use my businesses and they the first thing a lot of them say to me is I love I love your stuff and I don't agree with all of it right I spark good conversations I make smart people think critically about things and obviously that what I think doesn't apply to everybody so throw out the stuff that doesn't apply to you but I guarantee you some of the stuff might strike home with you how important is putting numbers in tweets yeah I think I have this one tweet about a white Escalade like if you want to the more if you can get really specific and it adds just a layer of humor like 20 hours a week on a computer casting spells just adds a layer of humor to the thought of like somebody it's somebody playing World of Warcraft it's that you picture that guy on South Park who's got his hand up on the desk and he's and he's really obese and he's eating chips while he's beating Cartman and their and all the friends at World of Warcraft right that's what you picture when you think of you know 20 20 hours a week casting spells so I I like to add a little bit of complexity I have this one tweet about salespeople and driving a white Escalade like I love to hire salespeople who are paycheck to paycheck but drive $120,000 white Escalade because they're super motivated to sell and they are highly determined to make it rain and they'll work super hard because they're cash strapped and it's just funny because we all know a lot of sales people like that um this isn't let's talk about Marshall this this one that you retweeted here why do you think uh why do you think this one blew up this was I actually I actually workshopped that with Marshall so we worked on that one together um because it's it's a promotion for somewhere. comom but I think that it's the same structure that we are talking about at the beginning okay we have a line at the top is just the wow factor right of like I should read this it's catchy it's the hook I sold my company For $52 million earlier this year that's the first line that says says Hey drop what you're doing and read the rest of this tweet because in reality somebody scrolling Twitter you get an eighth of a second of their attention you have to realize that like they are selfishly scrolling Twitter being like what can you do for me what can you do for me what can you do for me are you g to make me laugh are you going to make are you going to strike my emotion or are you going to teach me something those are the three things are you going to make me laugh or be entertaining in some way or are you gonna are you going to teach me something so you're trying to stop them in their tracks with that very first line just like my advice to every 25-year-old oh I might want advice because I might be I might have a kid who turns 25 or I just might be interested in this boom Marshalls I sold my company For $52 million not very many people done that I'm going to read I'm going to give it more than eighth of a second I'm going to give it four seconds so now you have four seconds and it's the the controversial part right my secret weapon I had two Americans on my team and 150 plus International Folks at the time of the sale wow Not only was this a remote company but 1% of his employees were us-based and 99% of employees his employees were overseas Finance Ops sales and then the rest of it we're selling right we're we're telling people what somewhere offers Finance people operations people salese developers even Executives and then bang this is the catchy one all for 80% less than us Talent you can do this too here are seven people ready to hire today that tweet got 1.4 million impressions and it drove 100 plus leads to somewhere. comom and it was worth a quarter million dollars of marketing for us and it was fre insane insane that's crazy and you did something else that was really smart here which is you could have just put higher sales people for $1,800 $100 a month but you did this can you explain why yeah we made it so that these people can see and like hear the voice of who they could potentially hire because everybody a business owner thinks oh I might hire somebody abroad and they think of what they get on the phone when they talk to a Filipino who works for Bank of America and they're like damn I really hope this person can actually help me but it's unlikely they're going to forward me around a culry and it's going to be kind of tough because Corporate America has trained us to think a certain type of person who works overseas but if you play Keegan's video he sounds like us he sounds like an American so yeah it's it's really it's really pretty cool so when they see that and they feel it it's uh it hits different and it sells much more effectively yeah and the platforms are optimized more for video now so I think it also just you know you're feeding the Beast the algorithm Beast as well you you mentioned something that's so important actually this is this is really hard because Twitter is changing so fast and I think Elon is Elon knows what he's doing and he's chasing engagement chasing daily active users and it's going to point him towards a Tik Tock Instagram type model so I'm worried that we're going all video over time on Twitter so it's kind of scary for guys like me what do you think well well I agree um just cuz the ad dollars are also in video but you seem to be like leaning into video right here like this this is working like I don't see many videos that have 700 likes how how do you what did you do here did you script this out um how important is the background talk walk me through your thinking on this one yeah so I recorded a 52 second video can you can you scroll just the very beginning of it so I can read that yeah um I can't remember exactly what I filmed what I said in this video oh yeah I'm saying repeat after me I will keep keep it simple I will copy what works and we're going to talk about this in the second half of our of our episode which is a maybe a pretty cool transition but yeah my videoos the exact same thing it's catchy because I have when when somebody's scrolling Instagram or Twitter I have one second of their attention so I have to catch it right away so let me tell you my advice to every entrepreneur in this world copy what works I will do boring things I will um you know avoid what's sexy I'll stop chasing everything that everybody else is chasing in the the world and I'm going to simplify it and I'm going to do boring things and the people who have succeeded in entrepreneurship most of them can really relate to that so that's why it took off very cool all right let's do one or two more uh bangers maybe this one three names you never share yeah it like I I I I just have a I wouldn't say it's a natural gift to be funny with word or anything I don't know if it's funny but it does hook so yeah three names you never share your babysitter your house cleaner and your attorney I've learned my lesson on all three and it's just funny this is a funny tweet because you really you cannot share your babysitter in the group chat or you will not be able to secure your babysitter next Friday when you need your babysitter and and you know someone's probably listening to this and and and thinking like why is Nick posting this how is this going to actually make his businesses better so you know what's the what's the ROI of of a tweet like this I think it's a it's a mix right most of my tweets are just trying to get smart people to think maybe there's some entertainment maybe there's some personal stuff to get people to know me and then there's trying to get smart people to think more critically about something and if I can get smart people and entrepreneurs to follow me then when I post a tweet like the one Marshall tweeted about International Talent um I'll be able to get $250,000 worth of business in the door that way so it's just a it's just a a constant process of trying to get attention trying to add value trying to make smart people think critically about something and then you ask it's the Gary ve jab jab jab jab jab Right Hook and the right hook is the ask hey let's do business pay me money for recruiting services or whatever yeah really it does really Prime the algorithm so if you do hit like a banger like this gets 1 th000 likes your next tweet uh maybe it's a lead magnet maybe it's something else but it does it does work more you'll notice it like if you if you click at somebody's tweet on Twitter you're going to see another one of their tweets the next time you open the app and start scrolling but if you scroll right by four people's twe you know one person's tweet four times you'll see that the Apple realized hey I don't want to see Nick anymore because you just scrolled past five of his ideas so I'm not going to show you his next couple so it really does prime the algorithm and your next tweet after a really high engagement tweet will get a lot of Engagement so you can use that to your advantage okay I want to do this last one from from you and then after this I want you to pick one Creator and we're going to like kind of look at one or two of their of their posts okay n Nikita is a genius copywriter so I pick him cool this football one what do you what were you thinking when you when you tweeted this I just talk a lot about how I think football is brutal on the brain and I'm not going to let my kids play it um and then I just see a kid here get laid out and obviously can cussed as a 5-year-old and it's sickening so just spreading just trying to spread I'm I'm not I don't have an agenda for engagement with this one I'm literally trying to talk other 35y olds like me to not let their play football right totally I I will also say like the quote retweet this is like a it does work a lot in the algorithm these days um you find something uh and then you can just you know add your POV on top of it and a lot of times it goes viral yeah you know who's good at that levels IO I don't know if you follow him Peter levels yep but he uh he's a massive quote retweeter so he like probably about 20% to 30% actually maybe more is him just quote retweeting and he gets massive engagement yeah he has the same strategy as me I think he has a lot of people who totally dislike him because he has what some people would call radical views just like I do but he stands behind his actual opinion and he's done the work to build his own opinions so I think he also gains a lot of respect so I think it's been a massive part of him building his brand is to not being afraid to ruffle some feathers totally yeah he went on the uh Lex Freedman podcast and basically um talked about PHP and like this a language that no not many people sort of write in and he he writes in it and and it's just it's a dividing thing to say that just like oh yeah just build something in PHP so I think he believes the stuff but he also does it to ruffle some feathers for sure quick ad break let me tell you about a business I invested in it's called boring marketing.com so a few years ago I met this group of people that were some of the best SEO experts in the world they were behind getting some of the biggest companies found on Google and the secret sauce is they've got a set of technology and AI that could help you outrank your competition so for my own businesses I wanted that I didn't want to have to rely on Mark Zuckerberg I didn't want to depend on ads to drive customers to my businesses I wanted to rank high in Google that's why I like SEO and that's why I use boring marketing.com and that's why I invested in it they're so confident in their approach that they offer a 30-day Sprint with 100% money back guarantee who does that nowadays so check it out highly recommend boring marketing.com okay this one Nik work on Twitter Nikita's work on Twitter has just been unbelievable I mean he writes so well his copy is so good like if you want to study copywriting forget me look at Nikita look at the way he structures obviously it's impossible to remake what Nikita does because he's so clever with his jokes not everybody is like a has the mind of a comedian but he's also brilliant when it comes to building consumer apps so he's built this reputation online where he is the guy to go to in the tech in the Tech Community when it comes to verality and consumer apps so he has just massive massive respect like here here we have Elon like obviously following Nikita I would not be surprised if those two get dinner soon he it's just leveling up his entire career because of the reputation that he's built on Twitter which is just it's awesome to see I'm so happy for him 100% yeah this is this is just so good a lot of his stuff is like very it's like not a lot of words too right yeah he doesn't do any threads or a couple threads but most of them and he and he's the perfect mix of like hey I'm going to show you how serious I am and how good I am when it comes to building consumer apps with a really thoughtful thing to say like on September 17th which is yesterday he tweeted about seating an app with users like he just gave a really good insight for people who are actually building apps and to get a really value falling of actual entrepreneurs and then right after that it's a my a huge joke about how European how how aggressive Europeans are about sexual advances and if they put an emoji in a tweet that means they're coming on to you only Nikita can follow up a tweet about seeding an app with users with hey here's how Europeans are coming on to you in a tweet in a in a message it's just hilarious yeah homies got range for sure absolutely I'm gonna put together just some takeaways I'll probably put in the comment section on YouTube around just like how how to how to tweet like Nick how to tweet like Nikita um cool um well Nick thanks for taking us through your mind there um [Music] baby

I want to show you how to write 30 plus or however many you want social posts with AI without sacrificing your own ideas or authentic city. Now I'm going to show you two different ways to do this. First is how to create your own workflow according to your own ideas, so on and so forth. And then the second way will be like the done for you route. All right. So the first thing we need to do is we need to create a step by step formula to write tweets with AI so that we can then teach AI how to write tweets. So here I simply searched on YouTube how to write viral tweets. And we're going to find one that teaches a good way to actually write tweets. So going through this, there honestly aren't that many. But that's not a problem because we're going to do this two different ways. So first I'm going to copy this one. This seems like the most promising. I'm going to open up cortex I'm going to go to chat. And then we're just going to tell it to break down exactly how to write tweets. All right. So I wrote break down exactly how to write a viral tweet based on this video. Include things like how to rate the hook, what type of topics to write about, how to structure the post, and what makes for a tweet that is relatable, has high reach and sparks engagement. I'm personally going to use Claude because that's just been the most consistent for me, and I'll press enter. Okay, so this is good. The actual output of this is pretty solid. I know how to write tweets, so it's good. It starts with a winning structure. Talks about hooks taking a strong stance, supporting with specificity. Closing with impact. Topic selection psychology okay so now what we need to do with this is we're going to turn this into a new document. And we're just going to name this how to Write viral Tweets for fun. We're going to delete this part of it and the rest of the AI output just so it's clear and concise and can teach the AI. And now the next thing I want you to do is to create a new document and just title this tweet structures. And then what you're going to do this is what's going to take some time if you want to do this, if you want to make the AI output really good, you're going to get 5 to 10 tweet structures that you really like. So you're literally just going to copy paste the tweets text into here. Now one thing I do inside of my cortex personally is I have this, meta document that contains all of my other documents, and I have a specific post styles document that has embedded tweets in each of these. Now, I can't read an embedded tweet. Twitter is actually pretty closed down now in terms of being able to pull information from Twitter. So unfortunately you just have to copy paste tweets from Twitter itself, which sucks. But if you can take the time to do this, I promise the AI output will be so much better. Okay, so I have all of my tweet structures or tweets I want to emulate inside of here, and they're just separated by example and then a specific type. And so once you have the tweets you want to reference inside of here I have ten. But now you go to chats and then you type something along the lines of okay, so I added the tweet structures document as context here that contains all of the actual tweets. And then I say break down these ten example tweets into their structure, spark common patterns between them, and really focus on what makes the tweets engaging and impactful. Break down the hook structure, psychological biases, content format and structure, and anything else that would accurately teach me how to rewrite the tweets myself. So I'm going to send that, see what the output is. Okay. So that gives us a big detailed list of what makes these tweets do well so that we can rewrite them and teach them to AI. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to save this as a document again. And then we're going to teach the AI using both of the documents that we've created, how to write tweets. All right. So we have this saved as a new document. I called it tweet structure analysis. And it has all of these here. Good good good. Now what we're going to do is we have these three documents, right, that we're going to feed as context to a prompt creator prompt. So you're going to go to write incredible AI prompts, and then you're going to say I want to create an AI prompt that okay, so I said I want to create an AI prompt that helps me write 30 viral tweets, guide me through two phases ideation and writing the actual posts. That way the prompt will help me come up with the ideas first, and then we'll write them all out. And I said 30 viral tweets, but you can write as many as you want here, and we can always refine the prompt as well. So then I said use tweet structure analysis to understand how to structure posts, use how to write viral tweets, to understand how to write posts, and use tweet structures as examples to write from. These are the three documents that we created earlier. Then I hit enter. All right. So what this spat out is a meta prompt that we can use over and over again. That gives it the role of being a viral tweet generator, gives it context as to what I want and then instructions. So phase one ideation coming up with actually really good stuff. You go through any social media course and this is what you're probably going to learn. And then phase two is execution. So writing them out and it's using effective structures. So we'll see how that goes. And then for each tweet draft publish the hook them really good okay. Constraints output format etc.. We're going to create a new document with this. And then I name this prompt Write Tweets because I store all of my prompts as documents. And so whenever I want to reference one I can just search prompt. And then it will pull up all of my prompts that I can reference. So what I mean by that is if we go to chat and then I add context prompt, and then I have all of my prompts here, I can go to write tweets and then I'm just going to say help me write tweets, hit send and then it asks a question. Phase one ideation to get started. Could you identify 3 to 5 broad topics you're knowledgeable or passionate about? These could be areas like business. Once you share these topics, we can dig deeper. All right. So this is where the cool stuff comes into play. Right. Because the goal with AI at least in my opinion, is to not come up with the ideas for you or write them for you. Right? It should be from your authentic experience because that's what makes the writing good. So thank goodness that the prompt actually did this for us. But I said philosophy, writing, productivity, self-improvement are the ideas that I want to generate. And then phase one philosophy and it asks for questions. And then same thing with writing, same thing with productivity. So you don't have to think in terms of writing content. You just have to think in terms of digging into your personal experience. And then the AI writes it in an effective way based on your ideas. Now, if you want AI to do the writing for you, we're going to talk about that in the next way that we generate tweets. But let let me answer a few of these okay. So I got those questions answered. Here's how I structured them a little typo here, but you can read through this if you'd like. I just answered the questions. I feel like I didn't even give that much to it just to test the capabilities of AI, but let's see what it does next. Okay, so I really like this because it didn't write all 30, it wrote ten and then asked me for feedback on them. So this is super cool. But tweet one happiness isn't found at the destination. It's found in the struggle. The climb is what gives life meaning, not the summit. Most people waste their lives chasing peaks when they should be falling in love with the ascent. It's pretty good. Not bad at all. Writing isn't creating writing, it's thinking on paper. The blank page isn't waiting for your creativity. It's waiting for your thoughts to organize themselves. Stop trying to create content and start trying to clarify your thinking them. Okay, these are pretty good. Now I'm just going to tell it to continue. So we have 30 tweets. Okay okay. So the second batch explores deeper applications of your insights. The tweets about perception interpretation are particularly strong okay. Really cool. Wow. Yeah. Your perception filter what you believe becomes what you notice. What you notice becomes what you experience. What you experience becomes your evidence. Your evidence reinforces what you believe. Brick. Holy crap. Okay, okay. Let's actually good for me at least. Look at this one. Two readers approach the same philosophical text. First reader, this is too abstract. Second reader this is immediately applicable. First reader this is impractical. A second reader this solves my problems. The different isn't in the text, it's in the reader. I would rewrite this, but this is good, right? This is a good starting point. So I can press continue again or just say it. All right. This is actually super cool. These tweets are actually very good. Surprisingly. This is a lot better than what I'm going to show you next and what's already in cortex. So if you want to write based on your ideas, do exactly what we did. I'll share these documents in the description just so you can access them and try this yourself. But I'd recommend doing it yourself and coming up with your own tweet structures, finding those that you want to emulate. Because this is all productivity philosophy, that kind of stuff. Okay. So the next way you can write tweets is to just go to chat, then go to create, then generate viral social posts. And right 15 I'm going to say text posts based on ideas from anything. I can drag a PDF in here, I can reference a previous newsletter that I've written. I can turn a YouTube video into text posts. I can do whatever I want, right? So I have a previous YouTube video saved inside of my cortex call, or I can just type the topic right. I can just say productivity and it does pretty well. But I also have the YouTube video how to get ahead of 99% of people. And this was previous this is my most viewed video. So it has a lot of potentially viral ideas inside of it. So if I hit send here, then it should write 15 text post based on what are already validated ideas. And this structure them in multiple different ways. It structures them in single sentences. It structures them in paragraph, it structures them in lists, so on, so forth. And then I can save this as a document and generate 15 more if I want to or generate as much as I want. So that was actually pretty cool. And I was surprised by AI's output. I just did that from scratch. I didn't even have that planned. So now you have a way to write social posts with your ideas. And I learned something new. There too. Is that that's that's pretty freaking cool. So you can try that out in cortex. As I said, the links to the documents that we created are in the description, but I recommend you create your own with that, please go through, try it out, let me know on Twitter what you come up with, what the tweets actually are, and I hope you enjoyed this video. We'll see you in the next one with more tutorials.
